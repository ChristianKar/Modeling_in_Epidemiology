# ST2_SEIR

This is a modeling project in epidemiology for ST2 course (Centralesupelec).

Compartmental models are a general modelling technique. They are used in epidemiology to simulate infectious illnesses mathematically. Labeled compartments are assigned to the population, such as S, I, or R. (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). Moving between compartments is possible. The labels' arrangement often indicates the flow patterns between the compartments; for instance, SEIS stands for susceptible, exposed, infected, then susceptible once again.

There are many variations of the SIR model, including those that take into account births and deaths, recovery without immunity (SIS model), immunity lasting only a short while (SIRS), a latent period of the disease during which the person is not contagious (SEIS and SEIR), and the possibility that infants can be born immune.
