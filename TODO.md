## Questions to Ask: 

1. Can we use the same data-set for our simulations?

## Graphs to plot: 

1. Spread of infection: "normalised" percent of infected pop./ susceptible pop. in each timestep
2.  

# Parameters to change: 

1. Incubation period data- LUCCA
2. Model a real disease, with parameters from that disease. LUCCA 
3. Different vaccination strats: 
    a. T=0 Vaccination or T=t Vaccination.                              DONE
    b. Periodic over days/scaled timestamps, over weeks etc.            DONE
    c. Const. num of doses: decide between continuous and all-at-once vaccination strategies QUENTIN 
    d. random vaccination OR select some people from each class - stratified vaccination. DONE
